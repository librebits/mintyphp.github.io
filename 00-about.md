MintyPHP aims to be a full-stack framework that is:

1.  Easy to learn (and debug)
2.  Secure by design
3.  Light-weight

By design, it does:

1.  … have one variable scope for all layers.
2.  … require you to write SQL queries (no ORM).
3.  … use PHP as a templating language.

Mainly to make it easy to learn for PHP developers.
