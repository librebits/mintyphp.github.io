MintyPHP is simple and easy to install. The minimum requirements are a web server and a copy of MintyPHP, that’s it! MintyPHP will run on a variety of web servers and operating systems.

## Requirements

- Apache or nginx (rewrite is not required)
- PHP 5.4.0 or greater
- mysqli PHP extension

While a database engine isn’t required, most applications will utilize one. MintyPHP supports MariaDB (and other MySQL compatible databases).
